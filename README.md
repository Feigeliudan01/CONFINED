# CONFINED - CCA ON Features for INter-dataset Effect Detection
### Using an ultra-fast implementation for canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
*CONFINED* was developed for the purpose of capturing replicable sources of biological variability in methylation data. These sources include, for example, age, sex, and cell-type composition. Importantly, the variation captured by *CONFINED* does not include any variability from technical or batch effects.

*CONFINED* is implemented in R and requires packages **Rcpp** and **RcppArmadillo**. Please install them prior to trying to install *CONFINED*. If you are using a mac and having installation issues, try installing homebrew or xcode then reinstalling **Rcpp** and **RcppArmadillo**. 

You can simply install *CONFINED* using **devtools**:
```
devtools::install_github("cozygene/CONFINED")
```
Please see troubleshooting at the bottom for compilation issues.


## Usage
As input, *CONFINED* takes mandatory arguments:
- Two matrices of size _m_ by _n1_ and _m_ by _n2_ (the number of rows is the same but not necessarily the same number of columns), where _m_ > both _n1_ and _n2_
-  _t_ - the number of features (methylation sites) to use (a sparsity parameter)
-  _k_ - the number of components to save (can save up to min{_n1_, _n2_} components)

The following inputs are optional:
-  _saveOP_ - boolean, save the output (_CONFINED_ components for each dataset and the ranked list of features) or not 
-  _outfile_ - the prefix for saving the output files (default is "Xi_CONFINED_components.txt" and "CONFINED_ranked_features.txt")
-  _thresh_ - The threshold for determining the rank of the low-rank approximation of the input matrices in the feature-selection step of the _CONFINED_ algorithm. The default is .95, and if there are no canonical variables with correlation > _thresh_, the rank is set to 1.

*CONFINED* returns a list containing two items:
-  _X1comps_ - the _k_ components for dataset1 produced by _CONFINED_ using _t_ features
-  _X2comps_ - the _k_ components for dataset2 produced by _CONFINED_ using _t_ features

### Demo
We provide two subsets of whole-blood methylation datasets from Liu et al.[1] and Hannum et al.[2] for an example of CONFINED's usage. Download the demo files <a href="https://mj-thompson.github.io/data/CONFINED_demo.zip">here</a>.

First load the **CONFINED** packages into R:
```
library(CONFINED)
```

Then, load the datasets:
```
dat1<-read.table("demo_data1.txt")
dat2<-read.table("demo_data2.txt")
```

Run _CONFINED_, saving the output with prefix "demo":
```
results<-CONFINED(X1=dat1, X2=dat2, t=3000, k=10, outfile="demo")
```

_CONFINED_ will then save the files
-  *demo_CONFINED_ranked_features.txt* - A file containing the list of features as sorted by *CONFINED*'s feature selection step
-  *demo_X2_CONFINED_components_t_3000.txt* - A file containing an _n1_ by _k_ matrix of the _k_ _CONFINED_ components for the individuals in the first dataset
-  *demo_X1_CONFINED_components_t_3000.txt* - A file containing an _n1_ by _k_ matrix of the _k_ _CONFINED_ components for the individuals in the first dataset

You can also use the components to predict various sources of biological variability. We provide two files of cell-type proportion estimates from the reference-based algorithm of Houseman et al.[3] as an example:
```
cellests1<-read.table(file = "demo_cellcomp1.txt")
sapply(1:10, function(i) sapply(1:dim(cellests1)[2], function(j) summary(lm(cellests1[,j] ~ results$X1_comps[,1:i]))$r.squared) )

cellests2<-read.table(file = "demo_cellcomp2.txt")
sapply(1:10, function(i) sapply(1:dim(cellests2)[2], function(j) summary(lm(cellests2[,j] ~ results$X2_comps[,1:i]))$r.squared) )
```
The call to sapply will return a matrix where each entry _ij_ corresponds to the R^2 value of predicting the *i*th cell-type's proportion using 1:_j_ components. Performance may not be optimal in the case of the demo as we have only provided about 5% of the entire datasets for the purpose of efficiency.


## An ultra-fast implementation for canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
If you only wish to use this software for performing quick canonical correlation analysis, it can be accessed from the *CONFINED* package:
```
CONFINED::CCA(X,Y)
```
_A_ and _B_ are the loadings that will project input matrices _X_ and _Y_ into maximally correlated space. _U=XA_ and _V=YB_ are defined as the canonical variables of _X_ and _Y_, where the columns of _X_ and _Y_ have been centered in order to make the columns of U orthogonal to each other as well as the columns of V orthogonal to each other. 

Our CCA algorithm is entirely based on that of R package **CCA** by Gonzalez and Dejean. We simply translated their code into C++ code using packages from **RcppArmadillo**, and all credit for the algorithm goes to them.


## Troubleshooting
OSX (Mac) may have a problem where "math.h" is not found. This can usually be mitigated by running in the Terminal:
```
xcode-select --install
```
or, alternatively on Mojave:
```
sudo installer -pkg \
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg \
-target /
```

Another common problem on OSX (Mac) is an error concerning "lgfortran" or "quadmath." Below, we list steps suggested by [The Coatless Professor](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/). On that website, there are invaluable troubleshooting steps. Here, we will attempt to give the smallest number of required steps to take. Please visit the link for further details.
### R >= 3.5.x
<details><summary>Instructions</summary>
  Install the latest version of clang from CRAN <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/clang-6.0.0.pkg">here</a> and install gfortran from CRAN <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/gfortran-6.1.pkg">here</a>.

Now, return to R and try installing *CONFINED* using:
```
devtools::install_github("cozygene/CONFINED")
```

If that did not work, try the following:
```
  # Create an R environment file if it doesn't exist to store a modified path
# VARIABLE
if [ ! -e "~/.Renviron" ] ; then
   touch ~/.Renviron
fi

# Add the clang6 binary path to R's local paths
echo 'PATH="/usr/local/clang6/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.Renviron

# Establish a symlink of gfortran into /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -s /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran /usr/local/bin/gfortran
```

If the above does not work and you've upgraded from R 3.0.0-3.3.3, try removing the old gfortran build, then reinstall the latest gfortran build:
```
# Download installer into working directory
curl -O http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2

# Remove _files_ associated with the binary
for file in $(tar tfz gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2); do
sudo rm -f /$file; 
done

# Remove empty _folders_ associated with the binary
for file in $(tar tfz gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2); do 
sudo rmdir -p /$file; 
done

# Delete the installer
rm -rf gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2

# Run the above step again
curl -O https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/gfortran-6.1.pkg
sudo installer -pkg gfortran-6.1.pkg -target /
rm -rf gfortran-6.1.pkg

# Establish a symlink of gfortran into /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -s /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran /usr/local/bin/gfortran
```

Now, return to R and try installing *CONFINED* using:
```
devtools::install_github("cozygene/CONFINED")
```



If the above steps still were unsuccessful, try installing XCode CLI and reinstalling clang/gfortran.
Copy and paste this into your Terminal window:

``` 
########### Xcode CLI

if [ ! -d "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools" ]; then

  # Create a temporary file for the header
  touch /tmp/.com.apple.dt.CommandLineTools.installondemand.in-progress

  # Figure out the correct Xcode CLI for the given mac OS
  PROD=$(sudo softwareupdate -l |
    grep "\*.*Command Line" |

Enter your password, then enter:
```
rm -rf clang-6.0.0.pkg

# Create an R environment file if it doesn't exist to store a modified path
# VARIABLE
if [ ! -e "~/.Renviron" ] ; then

rm -rf gfortran-6.1.pkg

# Establish a symlink of gfortran into /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -s /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran /usr/local/bin/gfortran
